# This file configures hosts for rcm-dockpulp. The first 6 sections are required,
# and they should each have the same keys. A given key indicates an
# environment dock-pulp can use with the --server option. So if you add a key
# called "devtest" and define it in each section, you will then be able to use
# a dock-pulp command like so:
#  $ dock-pulp --server devtest list
#

# These are the hosts Pulp runs on for your environments. Do not include any
# API endpoint paths like "/v1/api". These keys directly impact the URLs
# dock-pulp uses to make calls on the ReST API.

# cdnhosts are systems that serve out the content Crane redirects to. If you

# help with this; perhaps a shared NFS volume or rsync command in a cronjob...
